## Opening Hours Stress Test

Because the [parse-opening-hours](https://github.com/MoralCode/parse-opening-hours) library was created to parse large datasets of scraped COVID vaccination site opening hours for the [vaccinatethestates ingest pipeline](https://github.com/caVaccineInventory/vaccine-feed-ingest/), there was plenty of sample data available to test with.

this repository serves as a basica usage example and stress-test for this library by feeding it with large amounts of data from the massive GISCorps database of covid vaccination sites.

This is real world data with real-world quirks that parse-opening-hours hopes to take care of so more variations of opening hours can be supported.
